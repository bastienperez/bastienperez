👋 Hi, I’m @bastienperez
👀 I’m interested in all Microsoft stuff (onpremise like Active Directory, ADFS, GPO and online like Microsoft 365, Azure AD, Exchange Online, etc.)
🌱 I’m currently learning Python (PowerShell is good but for some needs, Python seems better)
⚠️ I barely never published my scripts on this Github profile. All my scripts are published either on my two oganization Github accounts @Clidsys or @ITPro-Tips
