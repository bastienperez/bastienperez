- 👋 Hi, I’m @bastienperez
- 👀 I’m interested in all Microsoft stuff (onpremise like Active Directory, ADFS, GPO and online like Microsoft 365, Azure AD, Exchange Online, etc.)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python (PowerShell is good but, for some specific needs, Python is better)
- ⚠️ You can find most of my scripts on my two organization Github accounts [Clidsys](https://github.com/clidsys/) and [ITPro-Tips](https://github.com/itpro-tips/).
